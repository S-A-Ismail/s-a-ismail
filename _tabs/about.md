I work as a Data Analytics Consultant at Systems Limited, a top IT services company in Pakistan. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology, one of the country's leading engineering institutes.

In my role as a Data Platform Engineer, I specialize in creating, setting up, and managing modern, cloud-based data solutions. I use various tools like Databricks, AWS, Python, Spark, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform. I've earned certifications in deep learning, data engineering, and lakehouse fundamentals from platforms like Coursera and Databricks.

As a team leader, I've managed a group of 10 platform operations professionals, ensuring smooth day-to-day operations and leading short-term projects to improve our platform. I've tackled challenging projects, including moving from Hortonworks to AWS EMR, setting up the Unity Catalog and Platform Observability, and deploying a third-party tool called Aily Labs.

I've played a key role in creating Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for implementing the Databricks platform across 12 workspaces and 8 business units.

I'm passionate about data and cloud technologies and enjoy sharing my insights on my Medium blog. You can also find updates on my projects on my GitHub account. I'm always eager to learn new skills and collaborate with fellow data and DevOps professionals.
